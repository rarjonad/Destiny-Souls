# Destiny-Souls
Small text-based RPG game written in Python.
I started learning Python and thought making a game would be a fun way to improve and explore different options.

## General info
The game features a classless system, allowing the player to build their character entirely as they desire without any constraint apart from skill/abilities requirements.

Some planned features are:
- Main Attributes
- Secondary skills
- Special combat abilities
- MP based magic system
- Perk/Quirk system
- Modular armor
- Endless Gauntlet
